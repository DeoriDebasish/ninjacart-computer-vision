## Business Problem
Ninjacart is India's largest produce supply chain company. They are pioneers in solving one of the toughest supply chain problems of the world by leveraging innovative technology. They source fresh produce from farmers and deliver then to business within 12 hours. An integral component of their automation process is the development of robust classifier which can distinguish between images of different types of vegetables, while also correctly labeling images that do not contain any one type of vetgetable as noise.

We have been tasked with preparing a multiclass classifier for identifying thes vegetables.

## Concepts Used
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- VGG Models
- ResNet Model
- MobileNet Model
- Data/Image Augmentation
- Transfer Learning
  
## Approach
- Performed image augmentaiton by rescaling and resizing all the images of the dataset to a particular height and width.
- Build a CNN model, fine tuned VGG, Resnet and Mobile Net models and trained these models and evaluating their performances.
